# ML

In this project I am attempting to understand machine learning and subsections of machine learning like NLP. 
From my personal research you can use a wide range of libraries and programming languages to do machine learning. From my understanding the capabilities in C# and the Dot Net core is very limited so I have chosen python and the NLTK, spacy library to get some practice in it  

So far I was able to find a way to detect different entities in a text and also find the most common token used in sentences so I can detect the topic in sentences and as a result use that to detect the topic of a text.

If a text has multiple sections, we can use the same algorithm for each sub section and break each section into a single report and use the report for any analysis needed
