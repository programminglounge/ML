# ML

In this project I am attempting to understand machine learning and subsections of machine learning like NLP. 
From my personal research you can use a wide range of libraries and programming languages to do machine learning. From my understanding the capabilities in C# and the Dot Net core is very limited so I have chosen python and the NLTK library to get some practice in it
